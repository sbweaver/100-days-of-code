# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## ROUND 1

### Day 1: January 01, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Did some CSS rule review and tried things out on CodePen. Encouraged 2 people on Twitter.

**Thoughts:** Had to drop out last time I tried - want to rock it this time.

**Link to work:** Used [The CSS Layout Workshop by Rachel Andrew](https://thecssworkshop.com) to review


### Day 2: January 2, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Forked the log for "100 Days of Code" on GitHub and got it started; worked on my mini-portfolio that I started for FreeCodeCamp when CSS Grid wasn't supported :)

**Thoughts**: Feels good to get this going again. Need to design this portfolio on paper so I have a plan. Now to see what someone else is doing...

**Link(s) to work**: not brave enough yet :D


### Day 3: January 3, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Worked more on my mini-portfolio - played with grid layouts for images

**Thoughts**: CSS Grid makes so much sense. So glad that it's finally in browsers.

**Link(s) to work**: still not brave


### Day 4: January 4, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Learned about and played with pure CSS images - signed up for the free course on Teachable by Michael Mangialardi

**Thoughts**: Pure CSS image basics are pretty simple - I can see the potential with this. It's fun to play with - not sure how you would approach accessibility - I guess you'd need to label them - maybe add words to one of the containers in the same color as the background? Will have to look into that. Maybe he has suggestions later in the course.

**Link(s) to work**: getting more brave...
