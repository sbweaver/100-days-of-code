# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## ROUND 1

### Day 1: January 01, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Did some CSS rule review and tried things out on CodePen. Encouraged 2 people on Twitter.

**Thoughts:** Had to drop out last time I tried - want to rock it this time.

**Link to work:** Used [The CSS Layout Workshop by Rachel Andrew](https://thecssworkshop.com) to review


### Day 2: January 2, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Forked the log for "100 Days of Code" on GitHub and got it started; worked on my mini-portfolio that I started for FreeCodeCamp when CSS Grid wasn't supported :)

**Thoughts**: Feels good to get this going again. Need to design this portfolio on paper so I have a plan. Now to see what someone else is doing...

**Link(s) to work**: not brave enough yet :D


### Day 3: January 3, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Worked more on my mini-portfolio - played with grid layouts for images

**Thoughts**: CSS Grid makes so much sense. So glad that it's finally in browsers.

**Link(s) to work**: still not brave


### Day 5: January 5, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Studying and playing more with pure CSS images

**Thoughts**: This is fun - decided to post my exercise

### Day 6: January 6, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Studying and playing more with pure CSS images

**Thoughts**: There are some cool tools for working with colors. Tried Pug too and that is really helpful - makes writing HTML divs very easy. Added some shape variables to my little exercise. Thanks for the tips, Mike Mangialardi :)

**Thoughts**: Weekends are sometimes harder...

**Link(s) to work**: none today


### Day 8: January 8, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Studying and playing more with pure CSS images

**Thoughts**: I have more fun coding earlier in the day. I get tired at night and I feel guilty when I'm not hanging with my kids... but then I'm so good at guilt :D

**Link(s) to work**: none today


### Day 9: January 9, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Playing with JS

**Link(s) to work**: none today


### Day 11: January 13, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Playing with simple CSS animation

**Thoughts**: Missed the last two days and I'm not sorry because my family comes before code. Started the pattern of beating myself up about missing two days and then decided, "NO! I'm doing this on MY terms." 

I tend to be a hard ass when it comes to myself. Got this inner critic that won't quit. That has got to stop. I've spent the last 5 years trying to undo many years of not trusting myself. I'm not doing guilt anymore. I'm trusting myself. I know the best path for me and my family and some days my daily goal-oriented tasks may not happen because my kids needed me. 

I'm thinking about writing a blog post about this. It's easy to get discouraged and start wailing on yourself. This is my 3rd time trying the #100DaysOfCode and I'm not giving up but I'm also going to do it my own way. 

I have a friend who manages a web design team. He says that designers tend to be introverts. I think that he also said - or maybe someone else did - that designers don't like people looking over their shoulders while they're working on a project. That is totally me. I want everything all polished and then I present. 100 Days of Code doesn't work like that. You just have to keep putting it out there every day and if you're a person who worries about what everyone else thinks, then when you miss a day, or your results are sub-par in your opinion, there is this funk hanging over you... if you let it. It's a mind-set thing and I am so sick of this mindset that worries about what other people think. This is my thing. I'm doing it for me. So I need to not give a flying f*** what anyone else thinks. For me. :) And it's not like I'm the center of the universe anyway - nobody is really reading this except for me. Ha!

Rant complete. Day 11 complete. Well, that's appropriate. Hail 11:11

### Day 12: January 14, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Working on my theme based on Underscores

**Thoughts**: Good to get back into this. Need to do some sketches on paper for ideas of what I want it to look like. 

**Link(s) to work**: none today


### Day 13: January 15, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Working on my theme based on Underscores

**Thoughts**: Slow going, but I'm refreshing my memory. It's fun to make your own theme. I like knowing some command line. 

**Link(s) to work**: none today


### Day 14: January 16, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Working on my theme based on Underscores

**Thoughts**: Plugging along. 

**Link(s) to work**: none today


### Day 15: January 17, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Working on my theme based on Underscores - reading the Codex at WordPress.org

**Thoughts**: Plugging along. Lots of good info at WordPress.org 

**Link(s) to work**: none today

**Thoughts**: Plugging along. Lots of good info at WordPress.org 

**Link(s) to work**: 


### Day 17: January 19, 2018

**Thoughts**: Almost have custom logo in header working - extra text is being added (the site title) above it - not sure why... 

**Link(s) to work**: 


### Day 18: January 20, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Working on my theme based on Underscores

**Thoughts**: Didn't get quite as much time today and forgot to Tweet - but my kid's team won the state Lego Robotics competition :) #KidsBeforeCode

**Link(s) to work**: 


### Day 19: January 21, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Working on my theme based on Underscores

**Thoughts**: Lots to learn on the WordPress.org site

**Link(s) to work**: 


### Day 20: January 22, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Working in Genesis themes and plugins

**Thoughts**: Wishing to use my underscores-based theme instead but Genesis might be safer and faster to use for certain projects...

**Link(s) to work**: 


### Day 21: January 23, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Working in Genesis themes and plugins

**Thoughts**: A little tired today but still having fun - wish I could spend more time doing this and not all of the other stuff I have to do  :)

**Link(s) to work**: 


### Day 22: January 24, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Working in Genesis themes and plugins a bit - not quite an hour

**Thoughts**: 

**Link(s) to work**: 


### Day 23: January 25, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Working in a Genesis child theme

**Thoughts**: I'm wishing to just move to my theme from Underscores with the containers stripped out so that I could use some grid. All of these wrap divs in Genesis are annoying me along with the ::before and ::after for clearing the floats. They "f" up my grids. I want the freedom to put things all over the page wherever I want... but it needs to be accessible and responsive... and this is supposed to be a quick site move... yeah, right. Why do I have to be such an idealist? Genesis adds a lot of nice canned functionality for a low budget website. I don't know. Ope! Just found GenGrid by Matt Whiteley on GitHub

### Day 24: January 26, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Working in a bunch of different WP themes - comparing things - looking at builders too for their speed but don't really want to use them... 

**Thoughts**: Overwhelmed by options... tomorrow's another day

**Link(s) to work**: 


### Day 25: January 27, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Listened to The Big Web Show with Zeldman and Jen Simmons  - listened to Jen's first Layout Land video on YouTube explaining explicit vs. implicit CSS grid layout; Working on my underscores theme. 

**Thoughts**: Mentioned by Jen: (want to check out Shape Path Inspector in Firefox Nightly); Implicit vs. Explicit CSS Grid: that was something that I've thought was pretty cool for a while but didn't know that's what those terms were describing; Keep going back to Morten Rand-Hendrickson's tutorial because it's hard to remember what I did the first time - it helps to be going back through it.

**Link(s) to work**: 


### Day 26: January 28, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Hoped to get into it today, but had too much paperwork - did about 3 hours yesterday so I'm calling it good for today. 

**Thoughts**: Wishing for a quiet day w/no interuptions to focus

**Link(s) to work**: 


### Day 27: January 29, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: More theme work. Working in header and navigation styles and functionality.

**Link(s) to work**:

**Thoughts**: This is getting fun :)

**Thoughts**: Did lots yesterday - that will count for today

**Link(s) to work**:  


### Day 32: February 3, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: More work in CSS on a theme

**Thoughts**: Busy week - hard to focus on intricate CSS with other people around but glad they're around :)  

**Link(s) to work**: 


### Day 33: February 5, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: More work in CSS on a theme

**Thoughts**: Missed yesterday but got to watch the Superbowl - go Eagles! Was nice to see them win. Remembered what it was like to walk down Broad Street and could imagine what the party was like :)  Made good progress on my theme.  

**Link(s) to work**: 


### Day 34: February 6, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: More work in CSS

**Thoughts**: Plugging along...

**Link(s) to work**: 


### Day 35: February 12, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: More work in CSS

**Thoughts**: Missed a few days - had a migraine that I couldn't shake and then had to catch up on other projects when I came out of it - i did code on the 7th and 8th but I obviously forgot to Tweet and log. Oh well. Back on this horse :)

**Link(s) to work**: 


### Day 36: February 13, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Back to my theme based on Underscores

**Thoughts**: Got a little bit done but I can't go to "lakesidezen.dev" on my installation of DesktopServer - it's saying the site is not secure (https? of course it's not) - I'm wondering if the new version that I've been putting off installing might fix that? I should bite the bullet anyway and install it since I'm stalled out anyway - - I will upgrade and then ask Dave at the next WP Meetup if I can't figure it out. A little frustrated. Wanted to keep going on what I was doing. You can't always get what you want... (you can't always get what you want a LOT when you're a developer!)

**Link(s) to work**:  


### Day 37: February 14, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: More CSS and studying theme structure (PHP) in WordPress

**Thoughts**: Kind of tired today - not sure where to start looking for help on a few things. Sometimes it's hard to find answers to questions. You have to know what questions to ask.

**Link(s) to work**:


### Day 38: February 15, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: more CSS and PHP - didn't get the Tweet/logging done

**Thoughts**: 

**Link(s) to work**:


### Day 39: February 16, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: more CSS - figuring some things out with other stuff

**Thoughts**: I need to do something like animation for a bit with CSS or get back to some Javascript...

**Link(s) to work**:


### Day 40: February 17, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: played with CSS animation on Codepen

**Thoughts**: I decided to do something fun and went back to Val Head's CSS Animation class on Lynda.com. Did exercise 3.1 using my own graphics on Codepen. Had to do a few little modifications since I replaced JPGs with SVGs. Containers needed "display: block;" on them to get them to show.

**Link(s) to work**: Not public yet but here: https://codepen.io/sgweaver/pen/07b2a7598ee9a995198623d6eaf26b9b

**Thoughts**: tired

**Link(s) to work**: 


### Day 43: February 20, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: trying to do some intricate SVG animation - it's taking some time to prepare the files...

**Thoughts**: I like doing animation... 

**Link(s) to work**: 


### Day 44: February 22, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: playing with CSS in some layout

**Thoughts**: Didn't get the tweet done - it's the Lionel Hampton Jazz Festival and I have kids in band so it's not all about me and had lots of work to do today... no worries. 

**Link(s) to work**: 


### Day 45: February 23, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: More work with SVG - getting closer

**Thoughts**: Not sure how this is going to work yet or what I'm going to do, but I'm getting things mapped out - this could be really fun. Had been wanting to look at Sara Souieden's blogs and info for a while. She has great stuff. Looking forward to working through some of that.

**Link(s) to work**: 


### Day 46: February 24, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Learning about SVGs from Sara Souieden (and Chris Coyier)

**Thoughts**: SVGs are pretty fun - why didn't I do this earlier... oh well. now I can. Everyone else in my family is watching Harmon Quest on the Raspberry Pi (our amplifier died :( )... wish I could get into gaming and DnD but getting into SVGs is more fun... Harmon Quest is pretty dang funny, though. Symbols are really neat. I'm excited to play with them.

**Link(s) to work**: I'm too introverted right now - maybe later...


### Day 47: February 25, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Playing with SVGs

**Thoughts**: I don't get viewBox yet... need to read more about that. Might try to make a color palette template with CSS similar to WSU's. Would be good to have ready to go for clients... 

**Link(s) to work**: [SVG viewBox on Codepen.io](https://codepen.io/sgweaver/pen/ea2c4c0888feea496df953c443e266e3) (not yet public)


### Day 48: February 27, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Back to my theme based on Underscores

**Thoughts**: Missed yesterday - Mr. Blue Screen of Death thwarted my efforts... Got new DesktopServer version installed. Got sites reconnected with new extentions (.dev.cc). Seems like the dropdown menu toggles aren't working now on my primary menu. Not sure why. 

**Link(s) to work**: 


### Day 49: March 1, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Playing with SVGs

**Thoughts**: Missed yesterday - Just couldn't fit it in... gave someone a marimba lesson, though :) Who doesn't love a marimba? Today was fun - I still don't get viewBox, though...

**Link(s) to work**: 


### Day 50: March 5, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on FreeCodeCamp mini portfolio so that I can pass it and get on to their Javascript lessons

**Thoughts**: Missed a few days for the PWA Retreat - taught a bunch of newbies how to make a free WordPress.com portfolio site - did some linocut pelicans too - - liking playing with CSS grid on CodePen. I need to do more playing with it to get more fluent.

**Link(s) to work**: getting close to posting


### Day 51: March 6, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on FreeCodeCamp mini portfolio so that I can pass it and get on to their Javascript lessons

**Thoughts**: Playing with all of the fun stuff - colors, transitions, grid - - need to play with type more

**Link(s) to work**: getting close to posting


### Day 52: March 9, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Been working some the last few days but I've been sick too and it was a very important someone's birthday which takes precidence.

**Thoughts**: Still making progress. I'm enjoying the little interactions with people on Twitter. I know that I'm not doing this challenge perfectly but with other obligations, I'm doing it to the best of my ability. I'm not going to beat up on myself about it because that does not support the goal of getting better at coding and being accountable in a positive way. 

**Link(s) to work**: no 


### Day 53: March 10, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Played with SVGs; kind of get viewBox now; worked with slice/meet and xMinYmin and other preserveAspectRatio values too using samples by Jakob Jenkov

**Thoughts**: It's interesting to see how these graphics are created. This could be fun to play with for displaying complex data visually. 

**Link(s) to work**: Thank you Jakob Jenkov for this tutorial -  [SVG tutorial at Jenkov.com](http://tutorials.jenkov.com/svg/svg-viewport-view-box.html)


### Day 54: March 11, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Got some time in

**Thoughts**: I'm learning. 

**Link(s) to work**: 


### Day 55: March 19, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on CSS. Watched one of Jen Simmons' videos on her Layout Land channel on YouTube. Played with the ideas on Codepen.

**Thoughts**: Missed a number of days because of a trip (not because i was lazy - because i needed to make family a priority). Glad to be back! I missed my hour of code. I also miss Verdana! What a pretty little typeface for the web. I miss how clean and crisp it looks. I guess when all of the webfonts came in I felt obligated to use them so things would look more modern. In the process I stopped using Verdana so much. I always liked the look of it. Maybe I'll start bringing it back into my repetoire :)

**Link(s) to work**: 


### Day 56: March 22, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Studying the Gutenberg project

**Thoughts**: Wondering if this is the best use of my time (Gutenberg course) - - but it's interesting and I'm understanding more of it than I thought I might. 

Doing life, family, running a business, and getting this in every day right now is a challenge. I'm not giving up on 100DaysOfCode though technically I'm probably disqualified... If I wait until a time when I know I can do it without more than a day missed I'll never get around to it. The goal is to code more, so I'm just going to do my best and keep going. 

**Link(s) to work**: 


### Day 57: March 23, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Worked in some Javascript - more tomorrow...

**Thoughts**: Not many today :)

**Link(s) to work**: 


### Day 58: March 24, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Back to Underscores theme. I installed Gutenberg plugin - going to see what I can do with that. 

**Thoughts**: After some quiet contemplation I am back to my main goal - working on my theme so that I can use it to play with grid. Will get back to Javascript later. Sounds like M. Rand-Hendrickson may have done some work with that already. Need to sleuth around some more to find out. 

**Link(s) to work**: 


### Day 59: March 26, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Played with Gutenberg and a new WP theme that has some grid built in. Interesting.

**Thoughts**: 

**Link(s) to work**: 


### Day 60: March 27, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Played with Gutenberg and a theme with my own grid layout. 

**Thoughts**: I like setting it up myself rather than trying to work within someone else's weird setup.

**Link(s) to work**: 


### Day 61: March 28, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Played more with Gutenberg and a theme with my own CSS grid layout. 

**Thoughts**: Sometimes I make one change and everything gets weird...

**Link(s) to work**: 


### Day 62: March 30, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: More with Gutenberg and a theme with my own CSS grid layout. 

**Thoughts**: need to keep working with this stuff to get more fluent. Gutenberg makes it easy to apply a grid to the blocks. Nice.

**Link(s) to work**: 


### Day 63: April 9, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: More with Gutenberg and a theme with my own CSS grid layout. Made some progress but mostly made a mess.

**Thoughts**: I worked some on paper after making a big mess on my live website. But it's just my presentation site for the WordPress Meetup, so I'm not worrying about it. 

I am somewhat discouraged that I missed so many days, but there were just too many other things that had to take precidence over this. I wish I could just sit around and play with code all day but I have too many other obligations. But I'm not giving up. And I did make some art which made me happy :)

### Day 64: April 10, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: More with Gutenberg and a theme with my own CSS grid layout. Made some progress but mostly STILL made a mess.

**Thoughts**: Some things aren't working as I would assume they should... Will keep trying to figure it out. 

**Link(s) to work**: [My WordPress Meetup Notes website](http://wpmeetup.susanweaver.net/)


### Day 65: April 15, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Playing with grid. Trying to see how I could automate the content coming in using different selectors. Got a page looking decent. 

**Thoughts**: I was trying to figure out how to select all of the content after each odd and then even h2 and make it alternate back and forth on the page with grid. I was using "h2:nth-of-type(odd) ~ p" (etc) to select all of the odd and then the same with even. It didn't work when you went back to odd, though, because the even was still applied (it doesn't start over at the next h2). Will be thinking about how to solve that if there's a way. It would be nice to be able to do it without having to add unique classes to items. It's interesting to think about. 

This is the kind of stuff that I miss doing. I really loved figuring out how to make stretchy boxes before there was border-radius. 

It's good to break things. I've just been trying to be kind to myself and let myself play with this stuff. Noticed that I'd forgotten a "." in front of a class and that's why my "span 3" wasn't working... finally :D  I suppose that's what happens when you're tired and trying to hurry. 

Mina Markham just Tweeted that she did something similar last week so I don't feel too bad! I'm reading Brené Brown's "Daring Greatly" - Mina is brave to show her vulnerability and I will try to be brave too. 
It's intimidating being a web designer. You're always assuming that everyone knows so much more than you and that you're not good enough. Need to let that go. I want to have fun with this as much as I can.

--------------------
FALSE START :(


### Day 01: August 30, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Getting development environment set up to try new project. 

**Thoughts**: Haven't looked at this stuff in a while. Refreshing my memory...

**Link(s) to work**: not today...


---------------------
THIRD TRY AT 100DaysOfCode -- Hope I make it!


### Day 01: January 03, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Working through the WPRig tutorial on LinkedIn Learning. 

**Thoughts**: Installed "dev-ip" to look at my local IP; Need to figure out what port I should be using because Browsersync isn't working; got Gitter up and running again; getting my development environment working always seems to be more of a headache than the actual coding; helped someone with some string contatenation in Google Sheets. 

**Link(s) to work**: none today


### Day 02: January 04, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: fighting with browsersync - it's watching but not letting me see the page... I can type the local URL in manually and see it; found out (on Twitter) that a new version of the WPRig tutorial will be coming out so maybe I'll wait for it and do something else

**Thoughts**: I've tried changing ports, added "https://" to the beginning of the proxyURL, can see that it is watching - command prompt shows that it's reloading but i get the following error in the browser, "This site can’t be reached localhost unexpectedly closed the connection." Posted in the Browsersync Slack channel - we'll see if I get any replies. 


### Day 03: January 05, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Took a break and played in Mozilla's Developer Tools instead of Chrome. Finding some things that I didn't realize were in there. Finished early because I spent more than an hour yesterday. 

**Thoughts**: Forgot to log yesterday that I asked Mor10 when he thought the new WP Rig tutorial might be out and he said that it would be a while. He suggested looking at the current one and then watching for the changes that are coming...
