# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## ROUND 1

### Day 1: January 01, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Did some CSS rule review and tried things out on CodePen. Encouraged 2 people on Twitter.

**Thoughts:** Had to drop out last time I tried - want to rock it this time.

**Link to work:** Used [The CSS Layout Workshop by Rachel Andrew](https://thecssworkshop.com) to review


### Day 2: January 2, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Forked the log for "100 Days of Code" on GitHub and got it started; worked on my mini-portfolio that I started for FreeCodeCamp when CSS Grid wasn't supported :)

**Thoughts**: Feels good to get this going again. Need to design this portfolio on paper so I have a plan. Now to see what someone else is doing...

**Link(s) to work**: not brave enough yet :D


### Day 3: January 3, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Worked more on my mini-portfolio - played with grid layouts for images

**Thoughts**: CSS Grid makes so much sense. So glad that it's finally in browsers.

**Link(s) to work**: still not brave


### Day 5: January 5, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Studying and playing more with pure CSS images

**Thoughts**: This is fun - decided to post my exercise

### Day 6: January 6, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Studying and playing more with pure CSS images

**Thoughts**: There are some cool tools for working with colors. Tried Pug too and that is really helpful - makes writing HTML divs very easy. Added some shape variables to my little exercise. Thanks for the tips, Mike Mangialardi :)
