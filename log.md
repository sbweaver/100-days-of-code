# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## ROUND 1

### Day 1: January 01, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Did some CSS rule review and tried things out on CodePen. Encouraged 2 people on Twitter.

**Thoughts:** Had to drop out last time I tried - want to rock it this time.

**Link to work:** Used [The CSS Layout Workshop by Rachel Andrew](https://thecssworkshop.com) to review


### Day 2: January 2, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Forked the log for "100 Days of Code" on GitHub and got it started; worked on my mini-portfolio that I started for FreeCodeCamp when CSS Grid wasn't supported :)

**Thoughts**: Feels good to get this going again. Need to design this portfolio on paper so I have a plan. Now to see what someone else is doing...

**Link(s) to work**: not brave enough yet :D


### Day 3: January 3, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Worked more on my mini-portfolio - played with grid layouts for images

**Thoughts**: CSS Grid makes so much sense. So glad that it's finally in browsers.

**Link(s) to work**: still not brave


### Day 5: January 5, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Studying and playing more with pure CSS images

**Thoughts**: This is fun - decided to post my exercise

### Day 6: January 6, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Studying and playing more with pure CSS images

**Thoughts**: There are some cool tools for working with colors. Tried Pug too and that is really helpful - makes writing HTML divs very easy. Added some shape variables to my little exercise. Thanks for the tips, Mike Mangialardi :)

### Day 11: January 13, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Playing with simple CSS animation

**Thoughts**: Missed the last two days and I'm not sorry because my family comes before code. Started the pattern of beating myself up about missing two days and then decided, "NO! I'm doing this on MY terms." 

I tend to be a hard ass when it comes to myself. Got this inner critic that won't quit. That has got to stop. I've spent the last 5 years trying to undo many years of not trusting myself. I'm not doing guilt anymore. I'm trusting myself. I know the best path for me and my family and some days my daily goal-oriented tasks may not happen because my kids needed me. 

I'm thinking about writing a blog post about this. It's easy to get discouraged and start wailing on yourself. This is my 3rd time trying the #100DaysOfCode and I'm not giving up but I'm also going to do it my own way. 

I have a friend who manages a web design team. He says that designers tend to be introverts. I think that he also said - or maybe someone else did - that designers don't like people looking over their shoulders while they're working on a project. That is totally me. I want everything all polished and then I present. 100 Days of Code doesn't work like that. You just have to keep putting it out there every day and if you're a person who worries about what everyone else thinks, then when you miss a day, or your results are sub-par in your opinion, there is this funk hanging over you... if you let it. It's a mind-set thing and I am so sick of this mindset that worries about what other people think. This is my thing. I'm doing it for me. So I need to not give a flying f*** what anyone else thinks. For me. :) And it's not like I'm the center of the universe anyway - nobody is really reading this except for me. Ha!

Rant complete. Day 11 complete. Well, that's appropriate. Hail 11:11

### Day 23: January 25, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Working in a Genesis child theme

**Thoughts**: I'm wishing to just move to my theme from Underscores with the containers stripped out so that I could use some grid. All of these wrap divs in Genesis are annoying me along with the ::before and ::after for clearing the floats. They "f" up my grids. I want the freedom to put things all over the page wherever I want... but it needs to be accessible and responsive... and this is supposed to be a quick site move... yeah, right. Why do I have to be such an idealist? Genesis adds a lot of nice canned functionality for a low budget website. I don't know. Ope! Just found GenGrid by Matt Whiteley on GitHub

### Day 24: January 26, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Working in a bunch of different WP themes - comparing things - looking at builders too for their speed but don't really want to use them... 

**Thoughts**: Overwhelmed by options... tomorrow's another day

### Day 25: January 27, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Listened to The Big Web Show with Zeldman and Jen Simmons  - listened to Jen's first Layout Land video on YouTube explaining explicit vs. implicit CSS grid layout; Working on my underscores theme. 

**Thoughts**: Mentioned by Jen: (want to check out Shape Path Inspector in Firefox Nightly); Implicit vs. Explicit CSS Grid: that was something that I've thought was pretty cool for a while but didn't know that's what those terms were describing; Keep going back to Morten Rand-Hendrickson's tutorial because it's hard to remember what I did the first time - it helps to be going back through it.

### Day 26: January 28, 2018
